/**
 
 The implementation of the default cell.
 
 1. Inform the calendar what class you want to use to display the cell by overriding `customCellClass`. The class which you return must be a subclass of `UICollectionViewCell`.
 2. Implement your UI in that class, using autolayout and code. (Interface Builder won't work here.)
 3. Implement `calendarView:willDisplayCell:inContext:`. In that method, cast the `UICollectionViewCell` to your custom class type and populate your UI.
 
 If you do not adopt `CKCustomCellProviding` somewhere in your app, the default implementation will use `CKCalendarCell` and its own configuration logic to display a user interface.
 
 While it is not necessary to declare the customCellClass property or the method signature here (becase we are adopting CKCustomCellProviding) it is here for clarity, and as an example.
