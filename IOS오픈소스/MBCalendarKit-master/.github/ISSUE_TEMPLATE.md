# Summary

_{{ Delete this, and leave a summary of the problem here. i.e. I tried to integrate MBCalendarKit into my project, and it's not buttering my toast correctly. }}_

## Steps To Reproduce

```
1. Create a new Xcode project.
2. Integrate MBCalendarKit with CocoaPods
3. Create a `CalanderView`
4. Ask the calendar view to butter toast.
```

## Expected Results

_{{ `CalendarView should have a `.butterToast(with butter: ButterAmount)` method. }}_

## Actual Results

_{{ `CalendarView`'s `.butterToast()` method doesn't take an amount parameter. This is an opportunity for a PR, btw. }}_

## Notes

_{{I did with Xcode version Foo on an iPhone Bar. Also, no luck in the simulator. I also tried implementing this myself, but I couldn't find the butterknife.}}_
