# Changelog

## [unreleased]
...

## [5.2.0] 2019-04-18
### Added
- Added .travis.yml to augment Carthage support.


## [5.1.0] 2017-09-11
### Added 
- Added a demo for first day of the week handling.
- Added a demo for animated week transitions.

### Changed
- Fixes for `firstWeekday` bug. (#73, #110, #127)
- Fix infinite loop in `CKCalendarViewController`'s delegate implementation.
- If we try to set the view model's `date` to the same exact date that it already is, we return. This avoids firing off an entire layout pass.
- `CKCalendarCell` now takes an integer for `setNumber` instead of an `NSNumber`. This method uses a `asprintf` to format the string. This can be faster in some cases.
- Use `[NSLayoutConstraint activateConstraints:]` instead of `[self addConstraints:]` in `CKCalendarHeaderView`. The docs say that `activateConstraints:` is more efficient.
- Use the ivar for getting the cell identifier inside `CKGridView` instead of the property accessor.
- Compute the `initialOffset` once in the calendar model and cache it on the flow layout subclass, to avoid duplicating this computation per cell. 
- `CKCalendarView` now checks for `self.window` before reloading.
- Calling `setDate:` on `CKCalendarModel` passing a date that is the same day as the current date will short circuit after clamping to minimum/maximum dates, and the delegate methods will not get called.
- No longer call `reload` in `CKCalendarView`'s init. We call it later in the object's lifecycle anyway.
- Removed calls to `super` in `touchesBegan:`, `touchesMoved:` and friends. Much faster! 
- Cache `firstVisibleDate` and `lastVisibleDate`
- Cache the font used in the `CKCalendarCell` class.
- Cache `CKCalendarModel`'s `dateForIndexPath` and `indexPathForDate` values.
- Cache drawn polygon images in the next/back buttons.

### Changed

- Update project settings to Xcode 9's defaults.

## [5.0.4] 2017-09-05
### Added
- Added an in-memory cache for date formatters.

### Changed
- Performance gains of about 60-75% when scrubbing 
- Audited `CKCalendarCell` for performance, including aggressive checking for changes before assigning new states, and reduced number of styling passes.
- Cache a string representation of the custom cell reuse identifier when we change the cell class instead of computing it at each call to `dequeue...`

### Removed
- Removed UIView(Borders), UIColor(HexString) and NSString(ToColor) categories for colors and borders.
